It can be a lot of work to pick the best plants for your home. At Bloom, we developed the **Plant Similarity Index** - 
a simple metric designed to identify similar plants. This can inspire you to make great choices or substitutions in a pinch.

#### What does it mean to be similar?

Not just the same color or name.
We look at a lot of factors to determine what's statistically similar:
height and width, plant type (e.g. perennial), leaf types, flower and foliage colors, and more.
Ideally, it should be a equally good fit for the space with some matching characteristics.
